This repository tracks my scripts for working on the uncertainty analysis of FRIDA.

The uncertaintyAnalysisManager.R is the main file.

To run the stella simulator is needed which needs to be obtained seperately, and unzipped into Stella_Simulator_Linux (or whatever you change the location.stella variable too), you could conceivably also use another version of Stella but that is not recommended.
